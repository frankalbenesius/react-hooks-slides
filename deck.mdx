# React Hooks

a Lunch & Learn
by Katie & Frank

---

# Who Is This For?

You know some React.

You've probably heard of Hooks, but you want to know more about them.

_TODO: maybe link to docs_

---

# The Heck Are Hooks?

They are functions.

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

---

# Why do they exist?

Sometimes React is annoying:

- complicated & long class components
- complicated patterns like "Render Props"

Hooks provide one way of avoiding these annoyances.

---

# useState

Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

---

# useState - Class Example

_TODO: insert React class example of this_

_TODO: render component side by side_

---

# useState - Hooks Example

_TODO: render component side by side_

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

# useEffect

A place to put side effects like mutations, fetching, subscriptions, timers, and logging.

Runs after every component render. Replacing class lifecycle methods.

```
useEffect(() => {
  // do this thing after render
})
```

---

# useEffect - Class Example

```

```

---

# useEffect - Hooks Example

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function Page({ loggedIn, children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (loggedIn) {
      document.title = "Online";
    }
  }, [loggedIn]);

  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

---

# useEffect - Fetch with Class

---

# useEffect - Fetch with Hook

```jsx
import React, {useEffect} from "react";

function CharacterList() {

  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("url").then(data =>
      setCharacters(data);
    )}
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {characters.map(character => (
        <div>{character.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

# useReducer

An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

---

# useReducer Example

```jsx
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

# Wait!

This looks a lot like Redux... ?

---

# useContext

Accepts a context object and returns the current context value for that context.

```jsx
const MyContext = React.createContext("some value");

// and then, in a function component:
const value = useContext(MyContext); // "some value"
```

---

# Can Replace Redux

useContext combined with useReducer makes a pseudo-redux.

TODO: link to code sandbox with deeply nested dispatch context

---

# Writing Custom Hooks

Intra-component logic is now composable.

todo: an example that shows how a set of a few hooks could be abstracted and packaged together into their own, more meaningful hook

---

# 3rd Party Hooks

NPM ain't just for components anymore.

TODO: gif

- useDebounce
- useMedia? // find better example
- useSWR // or not zeit version

---

# Final Thoughts

- Other hooks exist:
  - useCallback
  - useMemo
  - etc

---

## The End
