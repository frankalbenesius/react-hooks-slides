# React Hooks

a Lunch & Learn
by Katie & Frank

---

# Who Is This For?

You know some React.

You've probably heard of Hooks, but you want to know more about them.

---

# The Heck Are Hooks?

They are functions.

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

---

# Why do they exist?

Sometimes React is annoying:

- complicated & long class components
- complicated patterns like "Render Props"

Hooks provide one way of avoiding these annoyances.

---

# useState

Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

---

# useState Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# useEffect

- when do it run

---

# useReducer

- show with context

---

# but what if it were deeper?!

---

# useContext

- combine with reducer
- how can i use this to avoid deeply nested state & passing callbacks down?
