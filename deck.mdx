a Lunch & Learn

# Who Is This For?

You know some React.

You've probably heard of Hooks, but you want to know more about them.

---

# The Heck Are Hooks?

They are functions.

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

---

# Why do they exist?

Sometimes React is annoying:

- complicated & long class components
- complicated patterns like "Render Props"

Hooks provide one way of avoiding these annoyances.

---

# useState

- code example

---

# useEffect

- when do it run

---

# useReducer

- show with context

---

# but what if it were deeper?!

---

# useContext

- combine with reducer
- how can i use this to avoid deeply nested state & passing callbacks down?
